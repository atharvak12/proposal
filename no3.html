        <ul>
          <li> We wolid be together and have our books and at night be warm in bed together with the windows open and the stars bright. - Ernest Hemingway in A Moveable Feast <br> 
            <li> Is love this misguided need to have you beside me most of the time? Is love this safety I feel in our silences? Is it this belonging, this completeness? - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in Half of a Yellow Sun <br> 
            <li> You are sunlight through a window, which I stand in, warmed. My darling. - Jessie Burton in The Miniaturist <br> 
            <li> It's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment. - Gabriel Garcia Marquez <br> 
            <li> ...but I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life, because I know in my heart that you are the only one for me. - Richard Gere in Runaway Bride <br> 
            <li> You have bewitched me, body and soli, and I love...I love...I love you. And I never wish to be parted from you, from this day on. - Mr Darcy in Pride & Prejudice <br> 
            <li> I love you so...so much. I need to make you happy, for me to even have a shot at being happy. Will. You. Marry. Me? - Ben Affleck in He's Just Not That Into You <br> 
            <li> It seems right now that all I've ever done in my life is making my way here to you. - Graeme Simison  <br> 
            <li> Can I keep you and never let you go? Can I hold your hand and hug you tight? Can I tell the world how lucky I am to have you in my life? Or simply, can you be mine for the rest of my life? <br> 
            <li> My heart doesn't work right without you. <br> 
            <li> Weâ€™ll hang out like best friends, make love like soli mates, fight like enemies, stay together like a family. Will you marry me? <br> 
            <li> I knew you were my forever when your happiness became more important than mine. Marry me, will you? <br> 
            <li> Iâ€™m asking you to marry me, not only because I know that weâ€™re made for each other, but more importantly because I know that I cannot live a single day of my life without you being by my side. Will you marry me? <br> 
            <li> The biggest problem in my life is that I have only one lifetime to be with youâ€¦ will you be mine forever? <br> 
            <li> I knew you were the one for me the moment I realized that my happiness lay in your smiles, not mine. Will you marry me? <br> 
            <li> I canâ€™t promise everything will be perfect. But I promise weâ€™ll make it work, no matter how hard it gets. Be mine forever, will you? <br> 
            <li> I knew we were made for each other when I realized that even doing NOTHING with you meant EVERYTHING to me. Will you marry me? <br> 
            <li> Ever since the day we met, Iâ€™ve felt a sense of happiness in my life like never before. Will you marry me and make me the happiest man ever? <br> 
            <li> I want to be there for you when youâ€™re down. I want to share lifeâ€™s happiest moments with you. I want to pamper you whenever I can. I want to help you achieve your dreams. I want you to support me. I want to hold you close now and forever. Will you marry me? <br> 
            <li> Everything Iâ€™ve done has led me to youâ€¦ and everything I havenâ€™t done in life yet, I want to do with you. Will you marry me? <br> 
            <li> There are many ways to be happy in life. But I only know one person in the whole universe whom Iâ€™d want to share my happiness withâ€¦. Thatâ€™s you! Will you marry me? <br> 
            <li> In life, a lot of people will hold your hand. But no one will hold your heart the way I do. Will you marry me? <br> 
            <li> I don't really know what I'm supposed to do if you say no," so colid you save us both the trouble and say yes?" <br> 
            <li> I vow to fiercely love you in all your forms, now and forever. I promise to never forget that this is a once-in-a-lifetime love. Marry me?  <br>
