            <li> You taught me the real meaning of love. One look at your face sets my world straight! <br> 
            <li> Youâ€™re the only thing that exists in my world. Everything I do is just to see a smile on your face. <br> 
            <li> I love you not only for what you are but for what I am when I am with you. - Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br>

            <li> Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know. She shares my dreams, and I hope that someday I'll share her home. I found loveâ€”to carry more than just my secrets; to carry love; to carry children of our own. We are still kids, but we're so in love. Fighting against all odds, I know we'll be alright this time. Darling, just hold my hand. Be my girl. I'll be your man. I see my future in your eyes. - Perfect by Ed Sheeran <br>

            <li> 'Cause all of me loves all of you. I love your curves and all your edgesâ€”all your perfect imperfections. Give your all to me, and Iâ€™ll give my all to you. Youâ€™re my end and my beginning. Even when I lose, Iâ€™m  winning. - All Of Me by Charlie Puth <br> 
            <li> It's always better when we're together. Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together. Well, it's always better when we're together. - Better Together by Jack Johnson <br> 
            <li> I'll be your dream; I'll be your wish; I'll be your fantasy. I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, and I'll be everything that you need. I love you more with every breath. Trliy, deeply, I will be strong. I will be faithfli because I'm counting on a new beginning. A reason for living. A deeper meaning. - Trliy Madly Deeply by Savage Green <br> 
            <li> I'm so in love with you. Whatever you want to do is all right with me, 'cause you make me feel so brand new, and all I want in life is to spend my life with you. - Let's Stay Together by Al Green <br> 
            <li> I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky, and I swear like the shadow that's by your side. I see the questions in your eyes; I know what's weighing on your mind, and you can be sure I know my heart. - I Swear by Boyz II Men <br> 
            <li> 'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years. You'll only cry those happy tears, and though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart. - I Swear by All-4-One <br> 
            <li> My arms are reaching out, out across this canyon. I'm asking you to be my true companion. - True Companion by Marc Cohn <br> 
            <li> When I get older and lose my hair, many years from now, will you still be sending me a Valentine's, birthday greetings, and a bottle of wine? You'll be older too, and if you say the word, I colid stay with you. - The Beatles <br> 
            <li> Before I met you, I never knew what it was like to smile for no reason. Now that you're here, I think my entire life will fall into place. <br> 
            <li> For it is plain as anyone can see, we're simply meant to be. - Jack Skellington, The Nightmare Before Christmas <br>

            <li> From the day I met you, I knew I wolid love you for years to come and beyond! No wonder they call us a match made in heaven. I love you, and I can't wait to marry you. Will you accept my proposal? <br>
